Suppose that infile is a Scanner object associated with the file that
contains the following data: 27306 savings 7503.35. Write the Java
statements that read and store the first input in the int variable acctNumber,
the second input in the String variable accountType, and the third
input in the double variable balance.

Answer :

*Scanner infile = new Scanner(new FileReader("inData.txt"));
*PrintWriter outFile = new PrintWriter("outData.txt");

*int acctNumber;
*String accountType;
*double balance;

*acctNumber = infile.nextInt();
*accountType = infile.next();
*balance = infile.nextDouble();

*outFile.println("The account number is " + acctNumber + " the account type is " + accountType + " and the balance is " + balance);

Three employees in a company are up for a special pay increase. You are
given a file, say inData.txt, with the following data:

Miller Andrew 65789.87 5
Green Sheila 75892.56 6
Sethi Amit 74900.50 6.1

Each input line consists of an employeeâ€™s last name, first name, current salary,
and percent pay increase. For example, in the first input line, the last name of
the employee is Miller, the first name is Andrew, the current salary is
65789.87, and the pay increase is 5%. Write a program that reads data from
the specified file and stores the output in the file outData.txt. For
each employee, the data must be output in the following form: firstName
lastName updatedSalary. Format the output of decimal numbers to two
decimal places.
