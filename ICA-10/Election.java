/*
ICA-3
--------
Write a program (Election.java) that allows the user to enter the last names of five
candidates in a local election and the votes received by each candidate.

The program should then output each candidateâ€™s name, the votes received
by that candidate, and the percentage of the total votes received by the
candidate.

Your program should also output the winner of the election.

A sample output is:

Enter candidate's name and the votes received by the candidate
Johnson 50001
Miller 4000
Duffy 6000
Robinson 2500
Ashtony 1800
Candidate     Votes Received     % of Total Votes
Johnson        50001               77.76
Miller            4000                6.22
Duffy             6000                9.33
Robinson       2500                3.89
Ashtony         1800                2.80
Total            64301
The Winner of the Election is Johnson.
